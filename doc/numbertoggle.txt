*numbertoggle.txt*	Relative/absolute line numbers toggling

Author:  Latchezar Tzvetkoff <http://tzvetkoff.net/>

INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

While Vim's relativenumber option is great, you probably don't want to use it
all the time. NumberToggle allows you to quickly toggle between relative and
absolute line numbers and cleverly switches when you enter or leave insert
mode.

TRIGGER                                         *numbertoggle-trigger*

NumberToggle sets up <C-l> to toggle between absolute and relative line
numbers by default, but you can set up another trigger if you prefer.
If you want to toggle using <F2>, for example, put this into your
~/.vimrc file:

  let g:NumberToggleTrigger="<F2>"
